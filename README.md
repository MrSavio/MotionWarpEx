## **Combat using Motion Warping Example Project**



This example project is based off the Unreal Engine 5.6 Combat Variant, but poses useful for using Motion Warping for combat scenarios, the motion warping system it self can be migrated into any project that supports the Motion Warping plugin, although reverting back will require a bit more tedious copy pasting or reverse engineering of the code. 



Originally based off my "Combat Using Motion Warping Tutorial" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLbgC6-9klo\&t=32s) I have fully improved the system and created this example project that can be used as a starter project for your own uses, or for an example to take what you like and copy it to your own systems.
